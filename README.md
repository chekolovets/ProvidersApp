# ProvidersApp

## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
yarn

$ react-native run-ios
$ react-native run-android
```

1. The task took me around 8 man hours
2. Fixed image paths in the mocked API since the were doubled. Changed a few icons and a background image because it wasn't possible to export them from the design.
3. The most challenging part was to make it look similar on ios and android since some components might work differently on these two platforms.
